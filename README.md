# MachineLearningFrame

## Description
This is a machine Learning program Frame that will host a variaty of different data entries (e.g. Import from csv, database, xml etc.)


## The Idea
The idea of this frame is to allow users to upload their own data and have the program figure out the features and target of what it is looking for. With the data uploaded, the user can then input more data to order to get a prediction of the likelyhood of what they are looking for - this will then add and save the data to the training dataset to improve accuracy.
